### I'm Renato Dantas. 👋

![visitors](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=page.id)

- 👨🏻‍💻 I'm a full-stack developer. Like to stay tuned about new technologies, frameworks, programming language updates, tech trending topics and so on. As a developer, I like to find the best and simplest solutions for daily problems.
- 🇧🇷 I'm Brazillian, living at Brasília, Federal District. Speak portuguese as any Brazilian citizen, but I like to communicate in english, _así como en español_.
- 🍺 I appreciate a good beer. I believe the best ideas usually come from a bar table. 😄
- ✈ Travelling expands horizons.
- 🙆🏽‍♂️ I'm impressed how web, technologies and devices are evolving so fast! Sometimes it's sounds like hard to follow all changes, but we should stay focused on our purposes.
